## Overview

I used test driven development throughout the entire build for this project.
This includes using chrome developer tools to test for responsiveness and for general positioning of elements, I also used the dev tools and the terminal with the use of print statements in my python to help identify if there was any errors in the console and where the issues may of been arising from.


## Automated Testing

### Lighthouse

- Desktop Lighthouse report perfect scores all round!

![Desktop Lighthouse report](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-desktop.png)

- Mobile lighthouse report 

![Mobile lighthouse report](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-mobile.png)

### HTML validator

I have used the html validator [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
Initially many of my html files had either info's or warnings, which have all been corrected,
A couple of my html files had errors which have now also been fixed and are all clear of errors.

### CSS validator

- My css has come back with no errors and no warnings.

### JavaScript Validator

- Home page JavaScript validation on JShint

![JavaScript validation](documentation/validation/javascript-validation.png)

- As you can see if the above image it's coming back with two info's

- First one is about emailJS not being defined, I followed along the code institute tutorial for
  setting up emailJS and emailJS is initialized in my base.html file starting on line 11.
  
- Second is the function sendMail being unused, but this is called on line 7 in my contact.html page

## wave reports

![Review page](documentation/wave-reports/review-page.png)

- The pages above wave reports have zero errors and zero contrast errors, a few of them have alerts for possible headings and redundant link.

- The following pages below I was unable to get to use the wave report due to them being restricted pages
only for users who are logged in, but I have made sure anything that may be a contrast error has been
resolved, and making sure all the headings are there, and none are skipped.

- Add Book Page

- Edit Book page

- Add Review page

- Edit Review page

- Profile page

## Manual Testing

### Testing user Stories

- **First time Visitors**

|  Goals | How are they achieved?  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| As a first time visitor I want to be able to easily browse book reviews. | This was achieved by having a view reviews button under each book, easily visible to the user. |
| As a first time visitor I want to be able to navigate around the website with ease. | This was achieved by always having the navigation bar at the top of the screen, allowing for users to easily navigate around the website |
| As a first time visitor I want a website to visually attractive and provide good user experience | This was achieved by using a relatively simple design, with the colors being consistent throughout the whole site, and the use of the background image.  |
| As a first time visitor I want to be able to create an account.  | This was achieved by having the register navigation link always visible at the top of every page. |

- **Returning Visitor Goals**

| Goals  |  How are they achieved? |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| As a returning Visitor I want to be able to add/edit/delete reviews of other users books | This was achieved by creating a user profile page, where the users can see all their reviews, and all the books they have added themselves onto the website, each with their own edit and delete button.  |
| As a returning Visitor I want to be able to add a book not currently on the website. | This was done by comparing book names already stored in the database, along with the author name, and if none of these match whats in the database, then the users will be able to add a book onto the website, if not a flash message will appear on the add book form. |
| As a returning Visitor I want to be able to search for books with ease. | This was achieved by having a search bar in the top left of the screen in my header, which will allow users to search for anything ranging from books, to author names etc.  |
| As a returning visitor I don't want other users to be able to edit/delete my reviews or books I've added. | This was done by always thinking defensively while I was developing the app, always checking if users ore logged in, checking if users ID matches the ID's of the reviews, books etc. ![Code example of defensive programming.](documentation/testing-md-images/code-example.png) |

- **Frequent visitor goals**

|  Goals | How are they achieved  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| As a frequent visitor I want to be able to easily access all books I've added onto the site, and make changes and or delete them where appropriate. | This was done by having a profile page for every user who registers to readers realm, there are two sections on the profile page, one for reviews and one for book, and each do have their own delete buttons for users to be able to delete books where appropriate. |
