## Overview

I used test driven development throughout the entire build for this project.
This includes using chrome developer tools to test for responsiveness and for general positioning of elements, I also used the dev tools and the terminal with the use of print statements in my python to help identify if there was any errors in the console and where the issues may of been arising from.


## Automated Testing

### HTML validator

I have used the html validator [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
Initially many of my html files had either info's or warnings, which have all been corrected,
A couple of my html files had errors which have now also been fixed and are all clear of errors.

- Home page JavaScript validation on JShint

- As you can see if the above image it's coming back with two info's

- First one is about emailJS not being defined, I followed along the code institute tutorial for
  setting up emailJS and emailJS is initialized in my base.html file starting on line 11.
  
- Second is the function sendMail being unused, but this is called on line 7 in my contact.html page

- The pages above wave reports have zero errors and zero contrast errors, a few of them have alerts for possible headings and redundant link.

- The following pages below I was unable to get to use the wave report due to them being restricted pages
only for users who are logged in, but I have made sure anything that may be a contrast error has been
resolved, and making sure all the headings are there, and none are skipped.
